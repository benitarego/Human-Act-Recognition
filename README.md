# Human-Act-Recognition
The safety of senior citizens and children living alone at their residence have been a big concern for working individuals taking care 
of them. There is a need for a solution which can ensure 100% safety. So, the solution should be such that the working individual can 
monitor them from their workplace itself. 
All the activities are recorded in real-time, any suspicious actions is detected and alerted to the individual wherever he/she is, 
also monitoring through surveillance.
